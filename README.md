## üìö Documentation

- [Raspbernetes Docs](https://raspbernetes.github.io)
- [Kubernetes @Home Docs](https://k8s-at-home.com)

## üìã Requirements

In order to effectively utilize this repository, it is important to have the following tools set up in your environment.

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster
- [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/get-started/) installed
- [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) installed
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) installed

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Set up the necessary environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
export GITHUB_REPO=<your-repo>
export CLUSTER=<target-cluster>
```

2. Verify that your cluster satisfies the prerequisites:

```bash
flux check --pre
```

3. Run the bootstrap command to install Flux and deploy into the cluster:

```bash
task cluster CLUSTER_NAME=cluster-0
```

**Note:** _Many variables in the cluster depend on your specific configuration and should be modified accordingly. Be sure to review and adjust these variables as needed to match your environment and requirements._

## üñ•Ô∏è Technology Stack

The below showcases the collection of open-source solutions currently implemented in the cluster. Each of these components has been meticulously documented, and their deployment is managed using FluxCD, which adheres to GitOps principles.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has played a crucial role in the development and popularization of many of these tools, driving the adoption of cloud-native technologies and enabling projects like this one to thrive.
