patches:
  # REQUIRED: Due to the Flux controllers needing the ability to decrypt substitution variables used in the cluster-inventory
  # It's expected that the `$ task flux` command is used to bootstrap the secret initially into the cluster to ensure it already exists
  # The auto-generated kustomization cannot be changed as it may be reverted in subsequent bootstraps.
